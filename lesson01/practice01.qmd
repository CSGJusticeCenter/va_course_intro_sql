    ***Correct Answer: B***

2. What is SQL usually used for?
*(Select all that apply)*
    a. Creating and managing databases
    b. Writing code for mobile apps
    c. Querying and analyzing data
    d. Connecting relational database tables
    
    ***Correct answers: A, C, D***

3. In a relational database, data is typically organized into one large table to make querying faster. *(TRUE/FALSE)*

    ***Correct Answer: False***. Relational databases use multiple related tables to store data efficiently and minimize duplication.

## Exercise

1. Using the ERD provided in this course, identify the primary key and foreign key(s) in the following tables:
- `residents`
- `intakes`

![](images/corrections_erd.png)

<details>
<summary>Show the answer</summary>

`residents` 
   
- Primary key: `resident_id`

`intakes`

- Primary key: `intake_id`
- Foreign key(s):
  - `resident_id` (which references residents) 
  - `facil_id` (which references facilities)
  - `county_id` (which references counties)



## 

2. Write a query to retrieve all resident ids and their age at first arrest.

```{.sql .interactive .state_doc}

```


<details>
<summary>Show the answer</summary>

Query:
```{.sql .interactive .state_doc}
SELECT resident_id, 
       age_at_first_arrest
FROM residents;
```
