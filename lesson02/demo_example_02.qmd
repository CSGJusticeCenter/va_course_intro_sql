Suppose your supervisor asks for a list of residents who are male, over the age of 25, and have a known education level. They also want the list sorted alphabetically by last name so it’s easier to review. Let’s write a query to generate that list using the WHERE clause, a logical operator, IS NOT NULL, and ORDER BY.

```{.sql .interactive .state_doc}
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
       age_at_first_arrest,
       sex,
       ed_level_id
FROM residents
WHERE sex = 'Male'
  AND age_at_first_arrest > 25
  AND ed_level_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY last_name;
```
