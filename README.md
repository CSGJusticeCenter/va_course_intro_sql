# Virtual Academy (VA)

The Advancing Data in Corrections initiative includes a Virtual Academy, which builds data literacy and analytic capabilities within departments of corrections (DOCs) nationwide to further data-informed planning and decision-making. Through their participation in the Virtual Academy, corrections agency staff can access the program’s self-paced learning materials, community forum, peer-to-peer networks, and technical assistance at no cost.

The CSG Justice Center’s work on the Virtual Academy is funded by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). BJA is a component of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs.

The program is guided by the Virtual Academy Correctional Research Leaders Advisory Council, a group of five leaders in the field of corrections research and data analytics.

**Online Courses**   

Corrections analysts will be able to take the Virtual Academy self-guided online courses, accessible from any computer with an internet connection, to expand existing skill sets across a range of relevant topics. 

## Introduction to R 

[Intro to R Syllabus](https://csgorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Team-JC-Research/Shared%20Documents/VA/background/lms_courses/intro%20to%20R/Intro%20to%20R%20syllabus.docx?d=w5daa5b1538b94b57bfa77bf7809bceba&csf=1&web=1&e=iq3Vhh)

This course focuses on teaching you the basic skills and concepts you will need to use the R statistical programming language for working with data and running reproducible analysis. The R language is a powerful and flexible tool used for data analysis, data visualization, and statistics. Further, as an open-source tool, it frees you from the challenges of software licensing, black box technologies, and opaque cost structures. Yet, as with many programming languages, the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting.  

The aim of this course is not to make you an expert in R—that path is longer than we can cover in a single course. Rather, our intent with this course is to help you get over the initial climb and provide you with the basic skills and experience to work with the R programming language, ask the right questions, and manipulate data to conduct basic exploratory data analysis and visualization.  

Because learning programming in any language is not a spectator sport, this course is very hands-on. With each lesson, participants will be presented with data, R code, and instruction on how to use R to analyze the data. We will cover how to ingest, manipulate, summarize, and visualize data. Additionally, the course will cover the basics of setting up an R project for reproducibility by emphasizing rules, best practices, and frameworks for combining code with prose commentary.
