    "text": "Introduction\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing data stored in relational databases. As a corrections analyst, you likely work with large datasets containing information about individuals, facilities, incidents, and case processing. SQL allows you to efficiently retrieve, filter, and analyze this data, making it an essential skill for data-driven decision-making in the corrections field.\nThis lesson will introduce SQL, explain how relational databases are structured, and guide you through writing your first SQL queries.",

    "text": "What is SQL?\nSQL (pronounced “sequel” or “S-Q-L”) is the standard programming language used for interacting with relational databases. Unlike general-purpose programming languages like Python or R, SQL is specifically designed for managing structured data. It allows you to:\n\nRetrieve data from a database\nFilter and sort records based on specific criteria\nCombine data from multiple tables\nPerform calculations and generate summary statistics\nModify and update records in a dataset\n\nSQL is widely used in government agencies, law enforcement, corrections departments, and research institutions because it provides a reliable and efficient way to store and analyze data.",

    "text": "Why SQL Matters for Corrections Analysts\nAs a corrections analyst, you work with large datasets that track case records, time computation, facility populations, and supervision trends. These datasets are often stored in relational databases, which are structured collections of data organized into tables.\nRather than manually sorting through spreadsheets, SQL allows you to quickly answer questions like:\n\nHow many individuals were admitted to a correctional facility in the past six months?\nWhat is the average length of stay for individuals released in a given year?\nHow many pending cases are there in a particular jurisdiction?\n\nBy mastering SQL, you can retrieve insights more efficiently, ensuring that your reports and analyses are accurate and reproducible.",

    "section": "Understanding Relational Databases",
    "text": "Understanding Relational Databases\nA relational database is a collection of tables that store related data. Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). A table can be thought of like a spreadsheet, where each row represents an individual record, and each column represents a specific attribute of that record.\n\nKey Components of a Relational Database\n\nTables – The fundamental building blocks of a database. Each table stores a specific type of data (e.g., inmate records, facility details, time computation data).\nColumns (Fields) – Each column in a table represents a specific type of information, such as name, date of birth, sentence length, or housing assignment.\nRows (Records) – Each row represents an individual entry in a table, such as a specific inmate’s record or a particular facility.\nPrimary Keys – A unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., an inmate ID or case number).\nForeign Keys – A column that creates a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n\n\n\nExample: Corrections Data Stored in a Relational Database\nConsider a simple database that tracks facility populations. It might include tables like these:\nIn this example:\n\nThe Individuals Table records basic details about individuals, including their assigned facility.\nThe Facilities Table stores information about each facility.\nThe Facility_ID in the Individuals Table is a foreign key that links each person to a facility in the Facilities Table.\n\nThis structure allows SQL queries to pull insights from multiple tables efficiently.",
